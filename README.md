# Drivy Frontend Challenge

This coding challenge comes from [Drivy](https://drivy.com/), a french company with a cool product that I use and like. The engineering team at Drivy put up on Github their technical challenges and the frontend one looked very interesting so I decided to do it to learn new librairies or concepts I heard of but haven't had the time to try out.
You can read the guidelines and what the actual challenge is over their [Github repo](https://github.com/drivy/jobs/tree/master/frontend).
I initially [took up the challenge using React](https://github.com/MarionLivet/drivy-frontend-challenge-react).
